# Description

This project was coded in react using React-MDL components. At the time of development I was just relatively new with react so this project followed tutorials from Paul Hanna. I followed along and made changes where I saw necessary to make this project my own. 


# Installation

For those who wish to work on this project locally to play around with and make their own spin off it you will need a few things to get started. 

Use the package manager npm to install react.

npm i react

For hosting and developing locally install yarn.

npm i yarn
